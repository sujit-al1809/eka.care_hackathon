      question: "What is Swasth AI?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Swasth AI is an AI-powered clinical triage & diagnostic support system that speaks India's languages. It provides real-time voice conversations to help answer your health questions using advanced speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "How does the voice conversation work?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          The voice conversation follows a natural turn-taking flow. When you start a call, the AI introduces itself, then listens for your input. After you speak, it processes your speech, generates a response, and speaks back to you. This back-and-forth continues until you end the call.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Is my medical information kept private?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Yes, we take privacy very seriously. All conversations are encrypted and stored securely. We comply with healthcare privacy standards and do not share your medical information with third parties without your consent.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "Can Swasth AI replace my actual doctor?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          No, Swasth AI is designed to be a helpful clinical triage and diagnostic support resource but is not a replacement for professional medical care. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment.
        </span>
      ),
    },
    {
      question: "What browsers and devices are supported?",
      answer: (
        <span>
          Swasth AI works best in Chrome and Edge browsers. The voice features require a device with a microphone and speakers. Safari may have limited WebSocket support. Mobile devices are supported but may have varying performance.
